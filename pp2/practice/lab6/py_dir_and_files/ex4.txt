Fairies in Folklore and Literature
Fairy folklore is prevalent across many countries and cultures, each with its own unique characteristics and depictions of these mythical beings. Here's a brief overview of how fairies are perceived in different countries and cultures:

1. Ireland: The Aos Sí or fairies in Irish folklore are considered to be a supernatural race that live in an invisible world existing alongside the world of humans. This world is often accessed through ancient fairy mounds, or through fairy rings of mushrooms or stones. The fairies of Ireland can be benevolent or malevolent, and are often respected and feared.
2. Scotland: Scottish folklore also speaks of the Aos Sí, along with the Seelie Court (the good fairies) and the Unseelie Court (the evil fairies). Brownies and selkies are also part of Scottish fairy lore. Similar to Irish folklore, fairies are respected and often feared.
3. England: English folklore is rich with fairy tales, from small, insect-winged fairies to other beings like hobgoblins and brownies. Fairy rings are also prevalent in English lore, where they are thought to be portals to the fairy world.
4. France: The fées of French folklore are similar to the fairies of English tradition, often depicted as beautiful and capable of either good or ill, depending on their mood. Famous French fairies include Mélusine, a water fairy often depicted with a serpent or fish tail.
5. Germany: German folklore includes beings like dwarves and kobolds, which can be considered akin to fairies. The Lorelei, a siren-like being who lived on a rock in the Rhine River, is another well-known figure.
Norse/Scandinavian: In Norse mythology, there are beings like elves and dwarfs, akin to the fairies. The huldra is a particular fairy-like creature, a beautiful woman with a hollow back like a tree trunk, who can be both benevolent and malicious.
6. Slavic: In Slavic folklore, the "rusalka" are similar to water nymphs or mermaids, and "vila" are similar to the fairy beings, who live in the sky, clouds, and storms, and are usually benevolent.
7. Spanish: In Spanish folklore, particularly from the Asturias and Cantabria regions, there are tales of "xanas", fairy-like beings associated with rivers and springs, who often help people who do good deeds.
8. Japan: While not called fairies in a western sense, Japan's folklore includes spirits, or "yokai", that could be seen as similar in nature. For example, "kodama" are spirits that inhabit trees, and "yuki-onna" is a spirit associated with snow.
9. Native American: In some Native American cultures, small nature spirits akin to fairies are often depicted, like the "Nunnehi" of the Cherokee, a race of immortal spirit people who may befriend or assist humans.
While this list isn't exhaustive, it gives an idea of how widespread and varied fairy lore is around the world, each culture lending its unique lens to the representation of these fascinating beings.

Fairies are mythical creatures that have been present in the folklore and mythologies of various cultures throughout history. While their features, roles, and characteristics may vary, fairies generally tend to be magical beings connected to nature. Here are some examples of fairies from different cultures:
